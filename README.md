# MusicPlayer
We developed a Music Player Application where the user can listen to songs of his choice.
The application has three tabs Home, Library and Playlists.
Home Page displays the Welcome page along with the albums and playlists.
The library page displays the albums and if we click the album, we can view the songs available in that album.
The songs were added in the data folder under the resources folder in the code from where we can play the songs in the application.
In the playlist page user can create the new playlist he can also delete the existing playlist and he can open the playlist and can view the songs that are there in the playlist.
The user can click on the albums in the home page, and he has the options to play the song, pause and stop the song.
If the user pauses the song and again plays it gets played from where it is stopped but if he stops and plays the song again the songs get played form the starting.
There is also a dropdown in Play page where the user can select the playlist to which he wants to add that song later he can view the song from the playlist in the home page or from the playlist in the playlist tab.
If the user wants to view all the albums and playlists in the single page, he can click on the show all in the home page and can view all the albums and playlists.
We added two albums to the application and named them album1 and album2,Album1 has 4 songs and the album 2 has three songs.
The albums and songs can be added to the application in a simple way by adding them to the data folder.
